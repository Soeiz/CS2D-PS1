# CS2D-PS1
Counter-Strike 2D On the PS1

This project is based off the game called "CS2D" (this isn't CS2) released by the time of CS:S by Unreal Software, a top-down version of CS 1.6 with a lot of other features ! 

I use the [psyq+nugget]( https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds) SDK, but due to school and other works, I'll halt this project for a few moments.

If you want to modify or upgrade this code, be free to do so, and tell me about it !
